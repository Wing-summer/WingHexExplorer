WingSummer reserves the right to designate any additional new content or features as requiring separate payment or purchase of a separate subscription at any time. If you have entered into a separate support or similar agreement with WingSummer, then WingSummer will provide Software maintenance and support in accordance with the terms of that agreement, not this Agreement.

4. Term and Termination.
This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Section 4, will continue in effect for the initial subscription term specified in the Order. At the end of such initial subscription term and each renewal subscription term thereafter, subject always to timely payment of the Subscription Fees, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional renewal subscription terms having the duration specified in the Order (or if no renewal term length is stated in the Order, having the same duration as the Initial Subscription Term), unless either party provides at least 30 days’ prior written notice of non-renewal. Such initial subscription term and each renewal subscription term are each individually referred to herein as a “Subscription Term.” Each party will have the right to terminate this Agreement if the other party breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 10 days after written notice thereof, provided that, for breaches that cannot be cured using reasonable efforts within 10 days, then up to an additional 20 days to cure.

You acknowledge that upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Software and any license key may automatically de-activate and you may no longer be able to access and use the Software. Upon termination: (1), you must, at WingSummer’s option, either promptly destroy or return to WingSummer all copies of the Software and any WingSummer Confidential Information in your possession or control, provided that, upon agreeing to pay 25% of the prior years’ fee, we will allow you and your customers to continue to use the WingSummer Software for an additional three months; and (2) you shall not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees, except that you will be entitled to a refund of pre-paid fees if this Agreement is terminated by you for our breach and as provided in Section 7.3.
